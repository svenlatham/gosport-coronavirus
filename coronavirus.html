<h2>Current restrictions:</h2>
<h2>How the rules changed on 17 May</h2>
<p>Some of the rules on what you can and cannot do changed on 17
May. You can read the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">
'COVID-19 Response - Spring 2021' (the roadmap out of lockdown)</a>
for more information on how COVID-19 restrictions will be eased in
England. You can also read the <a href=
"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/364/made" rel=
"external">law</a> that underpins these changes and the ongoing
restrictions.</p>
<p>From 17 May:</p>
<p>You should continue to work from home if you can. When
travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan
your journey in advance.</p>
<p>You should <a href=
"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/"
rel="external">get a test</a> and follow the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">
stay at home guidance</a> if you have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering limits have been eased. Outdoor gatherings are
limited to 30 people and indoor gatherings are limited to 6 people
or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if
eligible).</li>
<li>New guidance on <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19">meeting
friends and family</a> emphasises personal responsibility rather
than government rules. Instead of instructing you to stay 2m apart
from anyone you don't live with, you are encouraged to exercise
caution and consider the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">
guidance on risks associated with COVID-19 and actions you can
take</a> to help keep you and your loved ones safe. Remember that
the risks of close contact may be greater for some people than
others and in some settings and circumstances, <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">
there will be specific guidance that you will need to follow even
when you are with friends and family</a>.</li>
<li>Indoor entertainment and attractions such as cinemas, theatres,
concert halls, bowling alleys, casinos, amusement arcades, museums
and children's indoor play areas are permitted to open with
COVID-secure measures in place.</li>
<li>People can attend indoor and outdoor events, including live
performances, sporting events and business events. Attendance at
these events is capped according to venue type, and attendees
should follow the COVID-secure measures set out by those
venues.</li>
<li>Indoor hospitality venues such as restaurants, pubs, bars and
cafes can reopen.</li>
<li>Organised indoor sport can take place for all. This includes
gym classes. It must be organised by a business, charity or public
body and the organiser must take reasonable measures to reduce the
risk of transmission.</li>
<li>All holiday accommodation can open, including hotels and
B&amp;Bs. This can be used by groups of up to 6 or 2 households
(each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</li>
<li>Funeral attendance is no longer be limited to 30 people, but
will be determined by how many people the COVID-secure venue can
safely accommodate with social distancing. Limits at weddings,
wakes and other commemorative events have been increased to 30
people. Other significant life events, such as bar/bat mitzvahs and
christenings, will also be able to take place with 30 people.</li>
<li>The rules for care home residents visiting out and receiving
visitors have changed, allowing up to five named visitors (two at
any one time), provided visitors test negative for COVID-19.</li>
<li>All higher education students are able to access in-person
teaching.</li>
<li>Support groups and parent and child group gathering limits have
been increased to 30 people (not including under 5s)</li>
<li>There is no longer a legal restriction or permitted reason
required to travel internationally. A traffic light system for
international travel has been introduced, and you must follow the
<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">
rules when returning to England depending on whether you return
from a red, amber or green list country</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Accessing Council services during the
pandemic</strong></p>
<p>We are working hard to continue to provide our services during

<p>Going forward we will continue to review updates&nbsp;from
government as they are published and assess what they mean for the
delivery of council services. In doing so our top priority is the
health and wellbeing of our residents, people who work in the
Borough, and our staff.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Social media scam</h3>
<p>Gosport Borough Council has been made aware of a survey scam
being used and promoted on social media.</p>
<p>The survey asks residents how they have coped with the COVID-19
pandemic and offered £25 for taking part. Participants are
requested to provide their personal details. It was alleged the
survey was sanctioned by a local authority but the council
concerned had no knowledge of the survey.</p>
<p>Any online surveys by Local Authorities will never ask for your
personal details, and definitely not your date of birth, national
insurance number or bank details. Gosport Borough Council would
like to remind all of our residents to take great care if asked to
provide personal details to any third party.</p>
