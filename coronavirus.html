<h2>Summary: what you can and cannot do during the national
lockdown</h2>
<p>You must stay at home. The single most important action we can
all take is to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>
<p>You should follow this guidance immediately. The law will be
updated to reflect these new rules.</p>
<h3>Leaving home</h3>
<p>You must not leave, or be outside of your home except where
necessary. You may leave the home to:</p>
<ul>
<li>shop for basic necessities, for you or a vulnerable person</li>
<li>go to work, or provide voluntary or charitable services, if you
cannot reasonably do so from home</li>
<li>exercise with your household (or support bubble) or one other
person, this should be limited to once per day, and you should not
travel outside your local area.</li>
<li>meet your <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">
support bubble</a> or <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubble</a> where necessary, but only if you are legally
permitted to form one</li>
<li>seek medical assistance or avoid injury, illness or risk of
harm (including domestic abuse)</li>
<li>attend education or childcare - for those eligible</li>
</ul>
<p>Colleges, primary and secondary schools will remain open only
for vulnerable children and the children of <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision">
critical workers</a>. All other children will learn remotely until
February half term. Early Years settings remain open.</p>
<p>Higher Education provision will remain online until mid February
for all except future critical worker courses.</p>
<p>If you do leave home for a permitted reason, you should always
stay local in the village, town, or part of the city where you
live. You may leave your local area for a legally permitted reason,
such as for work.</p>
<p>If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you should only go
out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential. You
should not attend work</p>
<h3>Meeting others</h3>
<p>You cannot leave your home to meet socially with anyone you do
not live with or are not in a <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">
support bubble</a> with (if you are legally permitted to form
one).</p>
<p>You may exercise on your own, with one other person, or with
your household or support bubble.</p>
<p>You should not meet other people you do not live with, or have
formed a support bubble with, unless for a permitted reason.</p>
<p><a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">
Stay 2 metres apart</a> from anyone not in your household.</p>
<h2>Detailed guidance on the national lockdown</h2>
<h3>Who this guidance is for</h3>
<p>This guidance is for people who are fit and well. There is
additional advice for <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">
people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus</a>
and households with a possible or confirmed coronavirus infection.
If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you should not attend
work, school, college or university, and limit the time you spend
outside the home. You should only go out for medical appointments,
exercise or if it is essential.</p>
<h3>Hands. Face. Space.</h3>
<p>Approximately 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus have no
symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it.</p>
<p>Remember - 'Hands. Face. Space.'</p>
<ul>
<li>hands - wash your hands regularly and for at least 20
seconds</li>
<li>face - wear a face covering in indoor settings where social
distancing may be difficult, and where you will come into contact
with people you do not normally meet</li>
<li>space - stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with
where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as
wearing face coverings)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all circumstances, you should follow the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">
guidance on meeting others safely</a>.</p>
<h3>When you can leave home</h3>
<p>You must not leave or be outside of your home except where you
have a 'reasonable excuse'. This will be put in law. The police can
take action against you if you leave home without a 'reasonable
excuse', and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice).</p>
<p>You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first
offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of
£6,400.</p>
<p>A 'reasonable excuse' includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is
unreasonable for you to do your job from home, including but not
limited to people who work within critical national infrastructure,
construction or manufacturing that require in-person
attendance</li>
<li>Volunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or
charitable services.</li>
<li>Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at
shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these
things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone
self-isolating.</li>
<li>Education and childcare - You can only leave home for
education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for
children where they are eligible to attend. Access to education and
children's activities for school-aged pupils is restricted. See
<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/education-and-childcare">further
information on education and childcare</a>. People can continue
existing arrangements for contact between parents and children
where they live apart. This includes <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubbles</a>.</li>
<li>Meeting others and care - You can leave home to visit people in
your <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">
support bubble</a> ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to
provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a
<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubble</a> (for example, to enable parents to work, and
not to enable social contact between adults), to provide care for
disabled or vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, to
attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or for respite care
where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a
person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a
looked-after child.</li>
<li>Exercise - You can continue to exercise alone, with one other
person or with your household or support bubble. This should be
limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your
local area.You should maintain <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">
social distancing</a>. See exercising and meeting other
people.</li>
<li>Medical reasons - You can leave home for a medical reason,
including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and
emergencies.</li>
<li>Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with
someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to
escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse). You can also leave
home to visit someone who is dying or someone in a care home (if
permitted under <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-home">
care home guidance</a>), hospice, or hospital, or to accompany them
to a medical appointment.</li>
<li>Animal welfare reasons - you can leave home for animal welfare
reasons, such as to attend veterinary services for advice or
treatment.</li>
<li>Communal worship and life events - You can leave home to attend
or visit a place of worship for communal worship, a funeral or
event related to a death, a burial ground or a remembrance garden,
or to attend a wedding ceremony. You should follow the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july">
guidance on the safe use of places of worship</a> and must not
mingle with anyone outside of your household or support bubble when
attending a place of worship.Weddings, funerals and religious,
belief-based or commemorative events linked to someone's death are
all subject to limits on the numbers that can attend, and weddings
and civil ceremonies may only take place in exceptional
circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave
home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related
to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or
where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or
referendum.</p>
<h3>Exercising and meeting other people</h3>
<p>You should minimise time spent outside your home.</p>
<p>It is against the law to meet socially with family or friends
unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You can
only leave your home to exercise, and not for the purpose of
recreation or leisure (e.g. a picnic or a social meeting). This
should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel
outside your local area.</p>
<p>You can exercise in a public outdoor place:</p>
<ul>
<li>by yourself</li>
<li>with the people you live with</li>
<li>with your support bubble (if you are legally permitted to form
one)</li>
<li>in a childcare bubble where providing childcare</li>
<li>or, when on your own, with 1 person from another household</li>
</ul>
<p>Public outdoor places include:</p>
<ul>
<li>parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public,
forests</li>
<li>public gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)</li>
<li>the grounds of a heritage site</li>
<li>playgrounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdoor sports venues, including tennis courts, golf courses and
swimming pools, must close.</p>
<p>When around other people, stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in
your household - meaning the people you live with - or your
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">
support bubble</a>. Where this is not possible, stay 1 metre apart
with extra precautions (e.g. wearing a face covering).</p>
<p>You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as
shops or places of worship where these remain open, and on public
transport, unless you are exempt. This is the law. <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">
Read guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>
<h3>Support and childcare bubbles</h3>
<p>You have to meet certain eligibility rules to form a support or
childcare bubble. This means not everyone will be able to form a
bubble.</p>
<p>A <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household#who-can-make-a-support-bubble">
support bubble</a> is a support network which links two households.
You can form a support bubble with another household of any size
only if you meet the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household#who-can-make-a-support-bubble">
eligibility rules</a>.</p>
<p>It is against the law to form a support bubble if you do not
follow these rules.</p>
<p>You are permitted to leave your home to visit your support
bubble (and to stay overnight with them). However, if you form a
support bubble, it is best if this is with a household who live
locally. This will help prevent the virus spreading from an area
where more people are infected.</p>
<p>If you live in a household with anyone aged under 14, you can
form a <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubble</a>. This allows friends or family from one other
household to provide informal childcare.</p>
<p>You must not meet socially with your childcare bubble, and must
avoid seeing members of your childcare and support bubbles at the
same time.</p>
<p>There is separate guidance for <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">
support bubbles</a> and <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubbles</a>.</p>
<h3>Where and when you can meet in larger groups</h3>
<p>There are still circumstances in which you are allowed to meet
others from outside your household, childcare or support bubble in
larger groups, but this should not be for socialising and only for
permitted purposes. A full list of these circumstances will be
included in the regulations, and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>for work, or providing voluntary or charitable services, where
it is unreasonable to do so from home. This can include work in
other people's homes where necessary - for example, for nannies,
cleaners, social care workers providing support to children and
families, or tradespeople. See guidance on <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">
working safely in other people's homes</a>). Where a work meeting
does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should
not - for example, although you can meet a personal trainer, you
should do so in a public outdoor place.</li>
<li>in a <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">
childcare bubble</a> (for the purposes of childcare only)</li>
<li>Where eligible to use these services, for education, registered
childcare, and supervised activities for children. Access to
education and childcare facilities is restricted. See further
information on <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/education-and-childcare">education
and childcare</a>.</li>
<li>for arrangements where children do not live in the same
household as both their parents or guardians</li>
<li>to allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as
well as between siblings in care</li>
<li>for prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children
who may be placed with them</li>
<li>to place or facilitate the placing of a child or children in
the care of another by social services</li>
<li>for birth partners</li>
<li>to provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or
illness, or to escape a risk of harm (including domestic
abuse)</li>
<li>to see someone who is dying</li>
<li>to fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury
service</li>
<li>for gatherings within criminal justice accommodation or
immigration detention centres</li>
<li>to <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-unpaid-care/guidance-for-those-who-provide-unpaid-care-to-friends-or-family">
provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable</a>, or to provide
respite for a carer</li>
<li>for a wedding or equivalent ceremony in exceptional
circumstances and only for up to 6 people</li>
<li>for funerals - up to a maximum of 30 people. Wakes and other
linked ceremonial events can continue in a group of up to 6
people.</li>
<li>to visit someone at home who is dying, or to visit someone
receiving treatment in a hospital, hospice or care home, or to
accompany a family member or friend to a medical appointment</li>
<li>for elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or
parents/guardians if they are under 18) - or those on an official
elite sports pathway - to compete and train</li>
<li>to facilitate a house move</li>
</ul>
<p>Support groups that have to be delivered in person can continue
with up to 15 participants where formally organised to provide
mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support - but they must
take place at a premises other than a private home.</p>
<p>Where a group includes someone covered by an exception (for
example, someone who is working or volunteering), they are not
generally counted as part of the gatherings limit. This means, for
example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaching
the limit, if they are there for work, and the officiant at a
wedding would not count towards the limit.</p>
<h3>If you break the rules</h3>
<p>The police can take action against you if you meet in larger
groups. This includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing
fines (fixed penalty notices).</p>
<p>You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first
offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.
If you hold, or are involved in holding, an illegal gathering of
over 30 people, the police can issue fines of £10,000.</p>
<h3>Protecting people more at risk from coronavirus</h3>
<p>If you are clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of
severe illness from coronavirus. There is additional advice for
<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">
people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus</a>.
Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable should not attend
work, school, college or university, and limit the time you spend
outside the home. You should only go out for medical appointments,
exercise or if it is essential.</p>
<h3><a id="Travel and transport information"></a>Travel and
transport information</h3>
<p>You must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse
(for example, for work or education purposes). If you need to
travel you should stay local - meaning avoiding travelling outside
of your village, town or the part of a city where you live - and
look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of
reasons you can leave your home and area include, but are not
limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>work, where you cannot reasonably work from home</li>
<li>accessing education and for caring responsibilities</li>
<li>visiting those in your support bubble - or your childcare
bubble for childcare</li>
<li>visiting hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits
where you have had an accident or are concerned about your
health</li>
<li>buying goods or services that you need, but this should be
within your local area wherever possible</li>
<li>outdoor exercise. This should be done locally wherever
possible, but you can travel a short distance within your area to
do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)</li>
<li>attending the care and exercise of an animal, or veterinary
services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan
ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This
will allow you to practice social distancing while you travel.</p>
<p>Avoid car sharing with anyone from outside your household or
your support bubble. See the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#private-cars-and-other-vehicles">
guidance on car sharing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Guidance for planning a safe journey</strong></p>
<p>Consider reducing your journeys by:</p>
<p><strong>Plan your journey</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your journey is necessary, can you travel locally and walk
or cycle to your destination? This reduces pressure on public
transport, the road network and helps reduce air pollution.</li>
<li>You must wear a&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#face-coverings"
target="_blank">face covering</a> while using public transport and

target="_blank">exempt</a>.&nbsp;Check with public transport
providers either on their website or by telephone&nbsp;as revised
routes and timetables are in operation.</li>
<li>Consider when you travel to avoid potentially crowded areas and
allow time for delays.</li>
<li>Think about the best route for your journey and consider using
a new or different route that avoids busy areas.</li>
<li>Wash and sanitise your hands before and after you travel.</li>
<li>Download the&nbsp;<a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" target=
"_blank">NHS COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and
check in where you see official NHS COVID-19 QR code posters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During your journey</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a distance of two metres where possible.&nbsp;<a href=

possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Completing your journey</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cycle or walk from public transport where possible.</li>
<li>If you need to use a taxi or public hire vehicle, you must wear
a face covering and follow the instructions of the driver. Please
be aware the driver is strongly advised to wear a face covering
during your journey.</li>
<li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands
as soon as possible when you reach your destination. Do the same
for children within your care if they have travelled with you.</li>

<p>There are four government funded national grant schemes to
support businesses affected by any periods of national lockdown, or
Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 local restrictions (Local COVID alert
levels 'High', 'Very High' and 'Stay at Home') that are
administered by local authorities:</p>

</ul>
<p>We appreciate the difficult situation that many Gosport
businesses are in as a result of the pandemic and are working hard
to implement the various grant schemes and make payments as quickly
and as diligently as we can.&nbsp; However as you will appreciate
we are also&nbsp;currently assessing a large number of applications
for each of the grants and&nbsp;responding to a high volume of
related enquiries.</p>
<p>Details of how to claim/apply for the grants referenced above
are available on the&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/businessrates">Business Rates
section</a>&nbsp;of this&nbsp;website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please check back
regularly for updates but for an overview of each of the grants and
the latest information on payments being made please see below:</p>
<h3>Local Restrictions Support Grant (Closed) (Addendum)</h3>
<p><strong><em>Tier 4 and Third National Lockdown
Update</em></strong>:&nbsp;<em>For the period from 19 December 2020
onwards to receive grant payments if your business was required to
close a Local Restrictions Support Grant Closed Tier 4 must be
applied for, see&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2036/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Closed-Tier-4">https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2036/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Closed-Tier-4</a>.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Once an application is processed regular automatic payments
will be made to cover the duration of the national lockdown. It
will also trigger the automatic payment of the Closed Businesses
Lockdown Payment, the one-off top-up grant for the period from 5
January 2021 to Spring 2021</em>&nbsp;<em>i.e. an application is
not required for this top-up grant.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Second National Lockdown Update</strong>: The grant
for the period from 5 November to 1 December 2020 is still
available to be paid to eligible businesses.&nbsp; If your business
was required to close and has yet to claim this grant
see&nbsp;</em><a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/2001">https://www.gosport.gov.uk/2001</a>.</p>
<p>Businesses registered as the business rates payer that were open
as usual and providing in-person services to customers from their
business premises and then required to close by law as a result of
national restrictions will be eligible for this funding.</p>
<p>For the period of the second national lockdown from 5 November
to 1 December 2020 businesses will receive a payment of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>£1,334 for premises with a rateable value (RV) up to
£15,000</em></li>
<li><em>£2,000 for premises with a RV over £15,000 and less than
£51,000</em></li>
<li><em>£3,000 for premises with a RV over £51,000</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For periods of subsequent Tier 4 and national lockdown
restrictions the payments are based upon complete 14-day periods
i.e. £667, £1,000 and £1,500 depending upon RV.</p>
<p>For the current period of Tier 4 local restrictions and the
third national lockdown from 19 December 2020 onwards, businesses
are receiving an initial payment to cover the period from 19
December 2020 to 4 January 2021&nbsp;i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>£809.93 for premises with a RV up to £15,000</em></li>
<li><em>£1,214.29 for premises with a RV over £15,000 and less than
£51,000</em></li>
<li><em>£1,821.43&nbsp; for premises with a RV greater than
£51,000</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The third national lockdown currently covers the six week period
from 5 January to 15 February.&nbsp; Therefore the following
additional payments are being made automatically to businesses that
have applied for the Local Restrictions Support Grant (Closed) Tier
4 and received the initial payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>£2,001 for premises with a RV up to £15,000</em></li>
<li><em>£3,000 for premises with a RV between £15,000 and
£50,999</em></li>
<li><em>£4,500 for premises with a RV greater than
£51,000</em></li>
</ul>
<p>No further payments will be made until after 15 February and any
government announcements relating to the national lockdown.&nbsp;
However, as per the government guidance, for every complete 14-day
period that the national lockdown continues further payments will
be made as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>£667</em>&nbsp;<em>for premises with a RV up to
£15,000</em></li>
<li><em>£1,000</em>&nbsp;<em>for premises with a RV between £15,000
and £50,999</em></li>
<li><em>£1,500</em>&nbsp;<em>for premises with a RV greater than
£51,000</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The payment amounts are fixed and set by government. Businesses
will be entitled to receive a grant for each eligible premises
within the restriction area. So some businesses may receive more
than one grant. Grant income received by a business is taxable.</p>
<p>Specific exclusions for this grant include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Businesses that are able to continue to trade because they do
not depend on providing direct in-person services from premises and
can operate their services effectively remotely (e.g. accountants,
solicitors).</li>
<li>Businesses that have chosen to close but not been required
to.</li>
<li>Businesses which have already received grant payments that
equal the maximum levels of State aid permitted under the de
minimis and the Covid-19 Temporary State Aid Framework.</li>
<li>Businesses that were in administration, are insolvent or where
a striking-off notice has been made.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Local Restrictions Grant (Closed)</h3>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: This local restrictions grant for
the period 3 December to 18 December is still available to be paid
to eligible businesses. If your business was required to close and
has yet to claim this grant please see:&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2026/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Closed-">https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2026/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Closed-</a></em>.
<em>The&nbsp;payment amounts are £809.93,&nbsp;£1,214.29 or
£1,821.43 dependent on premises RV to cover the additional days of
the restrictions.</em></p>
<p>During regional lockdowns where closures are required i.e. Local
Covid Alert Level 2 (Tier 2) or Level 3 (Tier 3) a revised version
of the scheme is implemented i.e. Local Restrictions Grant
(Closed), with payments made on a pro-rata 14-day qualifying
restriction period basis instead i.e. amounts of £667, £1,000 and
£1,500.</p>
<p>A claim form will be required to be completed for audit purposes
to ensure that the grant is being paid to the correct business and
into the correct bank account.</p>
<h3>Additional Restrictions Grant</h3>
<p><strong><em>Tier 4 and Third National Lockdown
Update</em></strong>:&nbsp;<em>For the period from 19 December 2020
onwards</em>&nbsp;<em>the grant application window will be opening

<p><strong><em>Second National
Lockdown&nbsp;</em></strong><em><strong>Update</strong>: The
application window for the&nbsp;Additional Restrictions Grant Tier
4&nbsp; for the period 5 November to 2 December 2020&nbsp;has been
closed.</em></p>
<p>Businesses that are non-business rate payers and business rate
payers that have either been required to close by Government during
the national lockdown period, or have been severely impacted by the
national lockdown period, are eligible for this grant.</p>
<p>The criteria and amounts are at the discretion of local
authorities so that the scheme can best meet local economic need.
An evidence based application form will also be required to be
completed to confirm eligibility i.e. businesses will need to
demonstrate how the pandemic and lockdown restrictions have
negatively impacted on them.</p>
<h3>Local Restrictions Support Grant (Open)</h3>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>:&nbsp;This grant for the period 3
December to 18 December 2020 is still available to be paid to
eligible businesses i.e. those in the hospitality and leisure
sectors. If your business</em>&nbsp;<em>was not required to close
but was severely impacted as a result of the local restrictions
please see:&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2027/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Open-">https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2027/Local-Restrictions-Support-Grant-Open-</a>.</em></p>
<p>Businesses that are not legally required to close but which are
severely impacted by the Local COVID Alert Level 'High' (Tier 2)
and 'Very High' (Tier 3) localised restrictions on socialising put
in place to manage the coronavirus e.g. hospitality, hotel, bed &
breakfast and leisure businesses are eligible for this
grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funding will be issued to Local Authorities in 14-day payment
cycles and they will have the discretion to determine the precise
eligibility criteria and payment amounts for this grant
scheme.&nbsp; However an evidenced based application will be
required from businesses.&nbsp; This grant is not available during
periods of national lockdown.</p>
<h3>Local Restrictions Support Grant (Sector)</h3>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>:&nbsp;This national restrictions
grant is still available to be paid to eligible businesses.&nbsp;
If your business was required to close and has yet to claim this
grant please see&nbsp;<a href=
"https://www.gosport.gov.uk/2003">https://www.gosport.gov.uk/article/2003/Local-Restriction-Support-Grant-Sector-</a>.&nbsp;
Eligible businesses will be paid a pro-rata grant for the period
from 1 November to 4 November 2020&nbsp;and Local Restrictions
Support Grant (Closed) payments for the national lockdown period (5
November to 2 December 2020).</em></p>
<p>Businesses registered with local authorities for business rates
purposes that were required to close in March 2020 and which have
never been able to re-open e.g. nightclubs, dance halls,
discotheques, adult entertainment venues and hostess bars are
eligible for this scheme.</p>
<p>Those businesses occupying premises appearing on the local
rating list on the date of the commencement of the restrictions
with a rateable value of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly £15,000 or under will receive a payment of £667 per
14-day qualifying restriction period.</li>
<li>Over £15,000 and less than £51,000 will receive a payment of
£1,000 per 14-day qualifying restriction period.</li>
<li>Exactly £51,000 or above will receive £1,500 per 14-day
qualifying restriction period.</li>
</ul>
<p>The payment amounts are fixed and set by government. Businesses
will be entitled to receive a grant for each eligible premises
within the restriction area. So some businesses may receive more
than one grant. Grant income received by a business is taxable.</p>
<p>There is no back-dating of the scheme, it began on 1 November
2020. During periods of national lockdown this scheme is superseded
by the Local Restrictions Grant (Closed) scheme. As a result for
the recent national lockdown eligible businesses will be paid a
pro-rata Local Restrictions Support Grant (Sector) for the period
1&nbsp;November to 4&nbsp;November 2020 and then a Local
Restrictions Grant (Closed) payment for the period 5&nbsp;November
to 2nd December 2020.</p>

<h2><a id="Social media scam - 24 Dec 2020">Social media
scam</a></h2>
<p>Gosport Borough Council has been made aware of a survey scam
being used and promoted on social media.</p>
<p>The survey asks residents to provide details of how they have
coped with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Participants are requested to
provide their personal details. It was alleged the survey was
authorised and sanctioned by a local authority, lending it an air
of authenticity. The council concerned had no knowledge of the
survey.</p>
<p>In the case we have been made aware of, a local resident was
duped by the apparently legitimate survey and provided their
personal details, i.e. name, address, DOB and NINO. The resident
was advised they would be paid £25 for taking part in the survey.
Fortunately, in this instance they declined the offer of payment,
otherwise it is likely the fraudsters would have obtained their
personal bank details.</p>
<p>Any online surveys by Local Authorities will never ask for your
personal details, and definitely not your date of birth, national
insurance number or bank details.</p>
<p>Gosport Borough Council would like to remind all of our
residents to take great care if asked to provide personal details
to any third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="NHS Test and Trace"></a>NHS Test and Trace</h2>
<h3>General information and advice for businesses, venues and
residents</h3>
<p>NHS Test and Trace or Public Health Officers will ask for these
records only where it is necessary. For example, if your premises
has been identified as the location of a potential COVID-19
outbreak. You and your staff must not share this information with
anyone else and respect individuals' privacy.</p>
<p>NHS Test and Trace will work with you, if contacted, to ensure
that information is shared in a safe and secure way. You must share
the requested information as soon as possible to help us identify
people who may have been in contact with the virus and help
minimise the onward spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>NHS Test and Trace will handle all data according to the highest
ethical and security standards and ensure it is used only for the
purposes of protecting public health, including minimising the
transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace, contact tracers

</ul>
<p>Local contact tracers may contact you from a different phone
number or ask you to call them back. If you are unsure if the
telephone number is genuine, check with your local council. More
information can be found on your local council website.</p>
<p>Contact tracers will never:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask you to dial a premium rate number to speak to them (for
example, those starting 09 or 087)</li>
<li>ask you to make any form of payment or purchase a product or
any kind</li>
<li>ask for any details about your bank account</li>
<li>ask for your social media identities or login details, or those
of your contacts</li>
<li>ask you for any passwords or PINs, or ask you to set up any

coronavirus symptoms</li>
<li>ask you to download any software to your PC or ask you to hand
over control of your PC, smartphone or tablet to anyone else</li>
<li>ask you to access any website that does not belong to the
government or NHS</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been told by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate,
either because you&nbsp;have tested positive for Covid-19 or have
been in contact with someone who has tested positive, you may be
entitled to some financial support during your self-isolation
period via the <a href=

<p><em>New NHS COVID-19 app</em></p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-covid-19-app-launches-across-england-and-wales">
new&nbsp;NHS COVID-19 app</a> is a vital part of the NHS Test and
Trace service and is now available to download for free.&nbsp; For
more information about the app, including help on how to use it and
finding out what different things it can do,&nbsp;and to download
it please see the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/">NHS
website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Guidance on the legal requirement to display official NHS QR
code posters</h3>
<p>To help control the spread of coronavirus,&nbsp;as&nbsp;from
24th September it is a <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/venues-required-to-enforce-rule-of-6-nhs-qr-code-posters-and-contact-logs">
legal requirement for certain businesses and venues to display
official NHS QR code posters</a>.&nbsp; It is is&nbsp;being
implemented to support the NHS COVID-19 app, which forms part of
the national coronavirus testing and contact tracing
programme.&nbsp; This legal requirement applies to those businesses
and venues that are open to the public which are already being
asked to use a logbook for Test and Trace i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>hospitality services, including pubs, bars, restaurants and
cafés</li>
<li>tourism and leisure services, including hotels, museums,
cinemas, zoos and theme parks</li>
<li>close contact services, including hairdressers, barbershops and
tailors</li>
<li>facilities provided by Local Authorities, including town halls
and civic centres for events, community centres, libraries and
children's centres</li>
<li>places of worship, including use for events and other community
activities</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a business or venue outside of these categories that
is visited by members of the public and has a space where people
congregate, then you are also encouraged&nbsp;to create a QR code
poster for the entrance to your&nbsp;business or venue.&nbsp; For
more information on which businesses or venues should display the
official NHS QR code poster please see the <a href=
"https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01183/en-us?parentid=CAT-01043&amp;rootid=CAT-01027">
NHS UK website</a>.</p>
<p><em>The official NHS QR code poster for businesses and
venues</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The NHS QR code poster will allow customers to check into
venues in a simple and secure way</li>
<li>Each business will need to generate posters for their venue
online at <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster</a>
and print them off to display at their premises</li>
<li>Each QR code is unique to a location, so if your business
operates from more than one venue, please create a separate QR code
for each location. You can add multiple locations in the
service.</li>
<li>Advice on how to create and where to display your NHS QR code
poster is available at: <a href=
"https://covid19.nhs.uk/information-and-resources.html">https://covid19.nhs.uk/information-and-resources.html</a></li>
<li>Any venue that has already set up their own QR code system for
Test and Trace is asked to replace it with an official NHS QR code
poster</li>
<li>Businesses will still need to keep an additional contact
information log for customers who do not have access to the NHS
COVID-19 app and cannot scan the QR code posters.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What this means for your customers and visitors</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The NHS COVID-19 app will alert customers if they have recently
visited a venue or business where a coronavirus case has been
confirmed and will instruct them to isolate - the app will only
instruct the person to book a test if they have symptoms.</li>
<li>The alert will be anonymous, meaning it will not name the exact
venue or service.</li>
<li>A week-long national information campaign will begin on 24
September to let people know about the COVID-19 app and how to use
it to scan QR code posters to check in at venues.</li>
<li>As <a href=
"https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01183/en-us?parentid=CAT-01043&amp;rootid=CAT-01027">
designated business and venues</a> will be legally required from 24
September to log customer and visitor details and display an
official NHS QR code poster, you will need to:
<ul>
<li>check when customers enter your premises that they have either
scanned your QR code poster or provided their contact details for
you to manually log</li>
<li>if there is more than one person, record the name of the 'lead
member' of the group and the number of people in the group (maximum
of 6)</li>
<li>if the person/lead member refuses to provide their contact
details by scanning your QR code poster or providing details for
manual logging, you will need to deny them access to your venue or
risk facing a fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Further information on the NHS COVID-19 app and QR code
posters</em></p>
<p>The NHS COVID-19 app will provide people with information about
the risk level for coronavirus in their local area, alert them if
they have been in close contact with someone who has tested
positive for coronavirus, and has a built-in QR scanner which
people who download the app will use to easily and securely
'check-in' at venues.&nbsp;</p>
