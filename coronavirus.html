local area.</li>

<h3><a id="COVIDRapidTestVol"></a>Volunteers needed now for new
COVID-19&nbsp;rapid testing site</h3>
<p>A new COVID-19&nbsp;Rapid Community Testing Centre is now open
at the Gosport Community Association (Thorngate Halls), Bury Road,
but still needs volunteers to help run it.</p>
<p>This site offers frontline workers who support the most
vulnerable in our community additional opportunities to get tested
regularly. This is essential to bring the infection rate down.</p>
<p>Volunteers are needed to offer reassurance and guidance to
people coming for the lateral flow test for Covid 19 at every step
of the process. The centre, operating on an appointment basis only,
aims to test 480 people each day or 2,400 people each week.</p>
<p>The testing site is expected to operate for six weeks on
weekdays only from 9 am to 5pm, but its operation could extend
beyond this if required. Volunteers are needed to assist staff in a
variety of straightforward roles during morning or afternoon shifts
of approximately 4.5 hours.</p>
<p>Volunteers will receive a COVID-19 test before the start of each
shift. Full training consisting of a short online course and site
briefings are provided along with onsite supervision, full PPE with
instructions, insurance cover and reimbursement of direct travel
expenses.</p>
<p>For safety reasons and in line with government guidelines,
volunteers must be between 18 and 70 years old, not on the Shielded
Patient List, and have no underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Volunteers are asked to commit to completing at least one full
morning or afternoon shift. A regular commitment of shifts during
operation of the site is especially appreciated to maximise
operational capacity.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Social media scam</h3>
<p>Gosport Borough Council has been made aware of a survey scam
being used and promoted on social media.</p>
<p>The survey asks residents how they have coped with the COVID-19
pandemic and offered £25 for taking part. Participants are
requested to provide their personal details. It was alleged the
survey was sanctioned by a local authority but the council
concerned had no knowledge of the survey.</p>
<p>Any online surveys by Local Authorities will never ask for your
personal details, and definitely not your date of birth, national
insurance number or bank details. Gosport Borough Council would
like to remind all of our residents to take great care if asked to
provide personal details to any third party.</p>
